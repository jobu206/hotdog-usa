He went on to break the school double under record with an earth-shattering 77 double unders and quickly joined the Leaping Leopards, a local competitive team from Lake Grove Elementary. In 2007, the coach of the Leaping Leopards retired, and Brian was invited to join Hot Dog USA, an invitation he gladly accepted. After enjoying competitive success under the training of the Hot Dog team, Brian became an assistant coach for the B Team in 2010. Since then, he has transitioned to Fusion Director and an assistant coach for the Junior and Senior A Teams. Brian has won multiple national and world championships, jumped for Cirque du Soleil, entertained crowds at NBA games, and performed at the 2012 London Olympic Games. In 2016, Brian co-founded the American Jump Rope Federation (AMJRF), which later became the recognized national governing body for jump rope in the United States. He currently sits on the executive board of AMJRF as the secretary general. Outside of jump rope, Brian is a Software Engineer at Wicket Labs and enjoys playing the piano."},{image:"/images/carlaLeroy.jpg",altText:"carla",bio:"Carla has been involved with the sport of jump rope, and Hot Dog USA, for over 30 years. She started competing at the age of 5 and continued for 18 years. While competing, she earned 18 national trophies, 2 world championships, and 2 world silver medals. Carla is grateful for the travel opportunities this sport has offered her. Her travels took her all around the U.S., as well as to Europe, Asia, and Australia. Her favorites include Sydney, Australia; Seoul, Korea; and Nome, Alaska. Coach Carla is grateful for her time as a competitive athlete but loves coaching just as much. She started mentoring younger jumpers as early as the age of 12 and transitioned to full-time coaching in the fall of 2004. She also spent many years training judges and judging in regional and national competitions. Carla graduated from Central Washington University with a degree in Elementary Education and a minor in dance in 2004. After graduating, she spent seven years as a teacher at Margaret Mead Elementary School before becoming a stay-at-home mom to daughters Emma (8) and Olivia (5)."},{image:"/images/christiHartman.jpg",altText:"christi",bio:"Christi is currently a para-educator at Helen Keller Elementary working with special needs children.
